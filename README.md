# Prediction Dividend Payout using Multiple Linear Regression
Felicia Dina Widyasari - Undergraduate Thesis

Dividends represent a company's distribution of profits to its shareholders and serve as a measure of financial performance. This study aims to predict dividend payout using the Multiple Linear Regression method, with independent variables including Earnings per Share (EPS), Debt to Equity Ratio (DER), Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Current Ratio (CR), and Firm Size. The evaluation compares the performance of a Simple Linear Regression model, which uses time (year) as the sole independent variable, with a Multiple Linear Regression model that incorporates financial fundamental variables.
